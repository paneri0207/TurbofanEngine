Turbofan Engine Remaining Useful Life Prediction

This project aims to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure for a turbofan engine, using historical sensor data to estimate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). It is intended to support proactive maintenance and increase system reliability by predicting failures before they occur.

Project Overview

Turbofan engines are critical components in the aviation industry, where unexpected failures can lead to costly downtime, safety concerns, and extensive maintenance. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of predicting the remaining operational cycles (or RUL) of an engine based on sensor data collected over multiple operational cycles.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes sensor readings from multiple turbofan engines across various operational cycles. Each record includes:

Cycle index: Sequential cycle number

Operational setting parameters: Parameters that may affect engine performance

Sensor measurements: Multiple sensors record key engine metrics, such as temperature, pressure, and vibration levels.

Data Source

This dataset is sourced from NASA Prognostics Data Repository, provided under an open data policy for research purposes.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Standardization, data cleaning, and feature engineering (e.g., computing cycle-based trends) are applied to prepare the data for training.

Feature Engineering: Key features, including time-based features and sensor trend indicators, are derived to enhance prediction accuracy.

Modeling: Various regression models, including Deep Learning (LSTM) and ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest), are used to estimate the RUL.

Evaluation Metrics: The model is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and MAE to assess prediction accuracy.

Modeling Approaches

Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting are used as baseline models.

Deep Learning Model: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, as RNNs are effective for sequential data and can capture time dependencies in sensor measurements.

Results

Model performance is evaluated based on the accuracy of RUL predictions. The final modelâ€™s performance metrics are as follows:

RMSE:
MAE:
R-Squared:
